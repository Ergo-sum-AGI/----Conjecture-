## 📜 Abstract

We present a fundamental correspondence between the quantum of action ($\hbar$) and the golden ratio ($\varphi$) as a universal fixed point in the renormalization group (RG) flow of information-processing systems. Building on the principle of minimal free energy in conscious systems and the principle of least action in physics, we formalize a dimensionless coupling $\kappa = (I \cdot \tau_P)/(2\pi\hbar)$ that converges to $1/\varphi$ at criticality. This conjecture, grounded in robust RG analysis showing $\varphi$ as an infrared-attractive fixed point with extraordinary residual control ($|\beta(\varphi)| < 2.2\times10^{-50}$), makes falsifiable predictions across neurobiology, quantum biology, and condensed matter physics.

## 🌟 Key Breakthroughs

### 1. **Mathematical Foundation**
- $\varphi$ emerges as universal RG fixed point for nonlocal kernel $G(r) \sim |r|^{-\alpha}$
- Unprecedented precision: $|\beta(\varphi)| < 2.2\times10^{-50}$, $\beta'(\varphi) = -0.809 < 0$
- Scale invariance at consciousness critical point: $\eta = \varphi - 1 \approx 0.809$

### 2. **Consciousness-Action Duality**
